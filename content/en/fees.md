## Payment Practices

Participants in training sessions are expected to pay the club's membership fee. In borderline cases, please send an email to hallitus@sleepwalkers.fi.

Seasonal fees are invoiced to active participants at the beginning of the season. One-time fees for occasional visitors are invoiced twice during the season.
