## Sleepwalkers Ultimate ry

    Jyväskylä Sleepwalkers is an ultimate frisbee club founded in 1999. We welcome new players of all levels year-round. No prior experience is needed, though a background in disc golf or team sports is a plus. We offer something for everyone: competitive play, dedicated recreation, or casual fun. You can join tournaments or simply attend training.

    Ultimate has three categories: open, women's, and mixed. We compete in all three, but our specialty is mixed play. All our training sessions are open to everyone.

    This focus on mixed play shows in our results: we've won several recent national bronze medals across indoor, outdoor, and beach ultimate seasons, and placed eighth in the 2020 Mixed Indoor European Club Championships.

    ## Ultimate

    Ultimate is a fast-paced, non-contact team sport played with a flying disc, blending elements from basketball, soccer, and American football. Remarkably, it's self-officiated even at the highest levels, driven by mutual respect and fair play.

    It's easy to start at any age. The sport offers constant physical and tactical challenges for dedicated athletes—making rapid improvement possible—while remaining perfect for purely recreational play.
