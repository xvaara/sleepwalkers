Jyväskylä Sleepwalkers is an ultimate frisbee club founded in 1999. We welcome new players of all levels year-round. No prior experience is needed, though a background in disc golf or team sports is a plus. We offer something for everyone: competitive play, dedicated recreation, or casual fun.

Ultimate has three categories: open, women's, and mixed. We compete in all three, but our specialty is mixed play. All our training sessions are open to everyone.

This focus on mixed play shows in our results: we've won several recent national bronze medals across indoor, outdoor, and beach ultimate seasons, and placed eighth in the 2020 Mixed Indoor European Club Championships.
